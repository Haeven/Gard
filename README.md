# Gard
Gard is a high-performance object-storage solution created for storage of highly-compressed video assets for fast-retrieval and low-energy consumption runtime.

This is the beginning of the TruTube Gard application, which will serve as a high-performance object-storage with AI-powered caching (automatically cache items during anticipated time of high-usage [morning after nightly upload]). Gard was named after the french word
``garder`` meaning "to keep". Thank you YHWH for everything, you are LORD of my life and king of my heart. In Jesus name GOD bless this project and code.
